# Day 7 Phase 066 - Codex / ChatGPT Account Proof

Generated: 2026-05-07 23:56 ET

## Objective
Check Codex/ChatGPT CLI/account surface without printing auth files or tokens.

## Actions
- Checked whether codex CLI is available in the production service shell.
- Did not print auth files.
- Did not run write actions.

## Result
| Item | Result | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI | not installed / command unavailable | NO-GO for CLI smoke |
| Codex auth | not checked by file; no auth file printed | blocked until CLI or approved connector exists |
| Paperclip Codex smoke | not run | blocked by Paperclip owner-session and Codex CLI availability |

## Blocker
codex_cli_not_installed_or_not_in_service_path.
